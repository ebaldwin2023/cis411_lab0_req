## 2. Requirements

Business

B.1 There must be a certain amount of product prepared at the beginnng of the shift in order for delivery to run as ordered. If multiple orders come in at once for delivery, we still need people in the cafe for the in person orders, so preparation is a must (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
B.2 You must gather information on what is popular among customers in order to be prepared at the start of the day and get a head start on preparing those in demand foods (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
B.3 The system must have a meter within it that shows if it is a busy time for delivery or not, and if so how much longer than usual orders will take to be prepared (L. Anderson, commonly feasts in Union).


User

U.1 The student or employee must have a Messiah account if they are ordering mobile, which must be linked to dining dollars or another approved method of payment (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
U.2 If they are ordering in person at the start of the day, for a future delivery they want made, a phone number or student ID must be required in order for order to go through (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
U.3 The user must properly and correctly identify in the delivery order receipt where they are located on campus, including building and room number (L. Anderson, commonly feasts in Union).
 

Functional

F.1 The system must only show the available food items only, not items that are not available or out of stock (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
F.2 The system must give users a time for delivery, making it clear that cook time is apart of the total time. Also, remember that delivery time cannot be a constant number, as some deliveries will take longer than others (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
F.3 The system should limit to only items that are able to be delivered. For instance, if icecream was not allowed to be delivered, the system should not show that the Union sells icecream (L. Anderson, commonly feasts in Union).


Non-Functional

N.1 If the user is ordering, but taking some time to complete the order, the system must prompt a notification to make sure the user is still there (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
N.2 The system must suggest the fastest food to get delivered (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
N.3 The system must prompt the user for a chance to tip the delivery person, this could be done within the website that the student or employee is ordering from (L. Anderson, commonly feasts in Union).


System

S.1 The system must be a webpage accessed from anywhere on campus, regardless of whether the user is on Messiah's network (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
S.2 Once initially signed in to the app or webpage and registering for delivery, your account must be remembered for a faster delivery process in the future (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
S.3 The system must require multi-factor authentication when initially signing on for delivery (L. Anderson, commonly feasts in Union).


## 3. Assumptions

A.1 It would be nice to have a feature where suggestions of popular food choices together make for a faster decision time for delivery. For instance, when ordering a burger, a nice feature would be to have the system suggest also ordering fries, or other popular items that are ordered together (G. Houngbeke, Union Employee).
